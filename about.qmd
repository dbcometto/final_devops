This site was created by C2C Ben Cometto for the Math 378 Stats Final Project.  It is all build with docker compose, and runs with wizardy... not to be confused with magic.

Docker compose is a system that allows multiple docker containers to be started simultaneously.  For this project, the `docker-compose.yml` file is as follows.

```
services:
  api:
    hostname: myapi
    image: devops-api
    command: python runapi.py
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  app:
    hostname: myapp
    image: devops-app
    command: python app-log.py
    ports:
      - 8090:8090

  web:
    image: devops-web
    ports:
      - 8095:80
    volumes:
      - ./docs:/usr/share/nginx/html
```
