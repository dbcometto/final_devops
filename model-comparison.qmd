Here we will explore different models on the Palmer Penguin dataset.  We are trying to create a model that predicts `body_mass_g` based on `bill_length_mm`, `species`, and `sex`.

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


df <- palmerpenguins::penguins
```


First, lets recall the relationship between `bill_length_mm` by `body_mass_g` and `species`.

```{r}
df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = body_mass_g, color = species)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

There is a lot of variance in the data, but let's start using linear regression.

```{r}
lm_spec <- linear_regression
```
