Thus, let’s implement a linear regression model, for simplicity and interpretability.\nRemember, our primary goal for this project is a proof of concept of developmental operations for data science. Thus, a simple, interpretable model will be best.\nThe following code chunk imports the dataset and creates a linear regression model.\n\nfrom palmerpenguins import penguins\nfrom pandas import get_dummies\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\n\ndf = penguins.load_penguins().dropna()\n\nX = get_dummies(df[['bill_length_mm', 'species', 'sex']], drop_first = True)\ny = df['body_mass_g']\n\nmodel = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)\n\nScikit for Python contains powerful tools that make creating models easy."

While far from perfect, it is good enough for demonstration purposes.\nWe can also access model parameters.\n\n\nIntercept: 2169.2697209393973\nColumns: Index(['bill_length_mm', 'species_Chinstrap', 'species_Gentoo', 'sex_male'], dtype='object')\nCoefficients&gt; [  32.53688677 -298.76553447 1094.86739145  547.36692408]\n\n\nThus, our model can be written as \\(m = 32.5 l -298.7 c + 1094.8 g + 547.3 s + 2169\\) where \\(m\\) is mass in grams, \\(l\\) is bill length in mm, and \\(c\\) and \\(g\\) are 0 or 1 depending on whether the species is Chinstrap or Gentoo, respectively, and \\(s\\) is 1 if sex is male.\nA few inferences that we can make is that for every 1mm of bill_length_mm, body_mass_g increases by 32.5g. Also, the Chinstrap species has less mass than the other two, and Gentoo has the most mass. Males are also, typically, heavier than females."
