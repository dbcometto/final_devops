Here we will create our model for the Palmer Penguin dataset.  We are trying to predict `body_mass_g` based on `bill_length_mm`, `species`, and `sex`.  

**The finished model can be accessed [here](https://{{< var apphost >}}:8090){target="_blank"}**.  It runs on a background API and a ShinyApp.  However, let's dive into how the model is created.

## Model Creation

Based on our [exploration](eda-basic.qmd), the data looks to have a somewhat-linear relationship.  Thus, let's implement a linear regression model, for simplicity and interpretability.

Remember, our primary goal for this project is a proof of concept of developmental operations for data science.  Thus, a simple, interpretable model will be best.

The following code chunk imports the dataset and creates a linear regression model.

```{python}
from palmerpenguins import penguins
from pandas import get_dummies
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn import preprocessing

df = penguins.load_penguins().dropna()

X = get_dummies(df[['bill_length_mm', 'species', 'sex']], drop_first = True)
y = df['body_mass_g']

model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
```

Scikit for Python contains powerful tools that make creating models easy.

## Model Information

Here, then, is some statistics from the model.

```{python}
#| echo: false
print(f"R^2: {model.score(X,y)}")
```

We can see that approximately 85% of the variance of the data is explained by our model.  While far from perfect, it is good enough for demonstration purposes.

We can also access model parameters.

```{python}
#| echo: false
print(f"Intercept: {model.intercept_}")
print(f"Columns: {X.columns}")
print(f"Coefficients> {model.coef_}")
```

Thus, our model can be written as $m = 32.5 l -298.7 c + 1094.8 g + 547.3 s + 2169$ where $m$ is mass in grams, $l$ is bill length in mm, and $c$ and $g$ are 0 or 1 depending on whether the species is Chinstrap or Gentoo, respectively, and $s$ is 1 if sex is male.

A few inferences that we can make is that for every 1mm of `bill_length_mm`, `body_mass_g` increases by 32.5g.  Also, the Chinstrap species has less mass than the other two, and Gentoo has the most mass.  Males are also, typically, heavier than females.
