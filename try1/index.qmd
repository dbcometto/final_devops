Welcome to C2C Ben Cometto's exploration of the penguin dataset.

![ChatGPT-Generated Penguins](gpt-penguins1.png)

According to its creators, the Palmer Penguins dataset exists "to a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to iris."  

That is exactly how we are using it.  Across this website, you will see an exploration of the data set, followed by the creation of a model.  You will be followed by our favorite three penguins, one of each species.

**The model is built into an API that can be accessed through a prediction app [here](https://{{< var apphost >}}:8090){target="_blank"}.**
