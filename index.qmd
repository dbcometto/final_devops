Welcome to C2C Ben Cometto's exploration of the penguin dataset.

According to its creators, the Palmer Penguins dataset exists "to a great dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to iris."  That is exactly how we are using it.  Across this website, you will see an exploration of the data set, followed by the creation of a model.  A similar model is used in an associated app that can be reached [here](http://localhost:8090){target="_blank"}.
